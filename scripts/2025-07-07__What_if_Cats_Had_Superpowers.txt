🎯 TEMAT:
What if Cats Had Superpowers?

🎬 SKRYPT:
What if cats had superpowers? Think about it—flying furballs, laser-eyed meows, teleporting tabbies! You'd never know who's harmless or secretly a savior. Picture Mr. Whiskers stopping a bank robbery or Mittens melting that tuna can with heat vision. And what if I told you... they already do? Ever feel like your cat is watching over you? Maybe they are, in their own whisker-twitching, purring way. Food for thought, huh? 🐱💥 #CatSuperheroes
