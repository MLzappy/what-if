What if cats had wings?

🎬 SKRYPT:
What if cats had wings? Imagine your fluffy feline friend soaring through the sky, effortlessly chasing birds or zooming through clouds. Picture them lounging on a high branch, only to spread their wings and take off into the sunset. But beware, as they might just swoop down and steal your snacks from above! So, my friend, if your kitty could fly, would they be your adorable guardian angel or mischievous little devil? 🐱✨
